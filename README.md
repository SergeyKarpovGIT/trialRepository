My name is Sergey Karpov.
I am highly interested in Mathematical Statistics,
Linear Algebra, and the implementation of theirs'
methods using:
Fortran, C, ShellScripting,
Perl, Python, SQL (via PostgreSQL), Go, R, and
corresponding to theese languages extensions
(e.g., matplotlib, pytest, dplyr, and ggplot2).
